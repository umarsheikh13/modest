# Modest

Modest is a simple minimal theme that loads all your posts infinitely in a clever little speech bubble. It's fully responsive and works on all devices and all the major browsers.

#### Colors

Apart from the accent and background color, the speech bubble border, avatar border and nav icon color can be changed on the Customize page.

#### Avatar position

The avatar position around the speech bubble can be changed on the Customize page.

#### Infinite scroll

By default the theme will load your posts infinitely but this can be switched off on the Customize page.

#### Google fonts

You can choose from over 20 of the best fonts on Google (www.google.com/fonts).

#### Mobile-ready

The theme is responsive so it can be viewed on mobile/tablet devices. To activate the mobile version of this theme go to Customize > Advanced options and turn off the "Use default mobile theme" option.
